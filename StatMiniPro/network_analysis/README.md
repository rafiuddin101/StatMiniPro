# Network Analysis without external libraries

This project provides a minimal implementation of network analysis using pure Python. We construct a simple undirected network represented by an adjacency list and compute basic metrics such as degree distribution and breadth-first search (BFS) centrality. Statistical network analysis has become an important area of research because network data differs fundamentally from traditional data, necessitating new statistical methods.

## Methodology
1. Represent the network as a dictionary of node: neighbors.
2. Compute degree distribution.
3. Compute BFS distances from a selected source node.
4. Visualize degree distribution.

## How to Use
Run `python network_analysis.py` to build the network, compute metrics, and save a plot of the degree distribution.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt`.
