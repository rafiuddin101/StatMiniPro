# Causal Inference Example

        This project demonstrates basic causal inference using propensity scores. We simulate a dataset with a binary treatment, covariates, and an outcome. We estimate propensity scores using logistic regression and compute the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) using inverse probability weighting. Causal inference techniques are increasingly integrated with machine learning and deep learning methods.

## Methodology
1. Generate synthetic data with a treatment indicator, covariates, and an outcome.
2. Estimate propensity scores using logistic regression.
3. Compute ATT using inverse probability weights.

## How to Use
Run `python causal_inference.py` to simulate data, estimate propensity scores, and compute the ATT.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt`.
