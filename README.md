This repository contains a curated collection of Python projects that demonstrate applications of statistical tools in emerging fields of statistics—excluding biology. Each project resides in its own directory with a README, code, and a local git history. The projects cover:

Time-Series Forecasting (Statsmodels) – ARIMA modelling of atmospheric CO₂ data.

Bayesian Linear Regression – Conjugate prior-based regression on synthetic economic data.

Fairness in Machine Learning – Logistic regression and demographic parity adjustment on a synthetic dataset.

Network Analysis – Minimal graph analysis without external libraries, computing degree distributions and BFS centrality.

Big Data Divide‑and‑Conquer – Simulated MapReduce-style logistic regression over large datasets.

Causal Inference – Propensity score estimation and inverse probability weighting for treatment effect estimation.

Explore each folder to see the code, requirements, and background notes. This collection aims to illustrate how traditional and modern statistical techniques can address complex data challenges across multiple domains.
